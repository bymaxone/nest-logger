/**
 * Purpose: fail when a TypeScript snippet in `docs/` uses one of this package's own
 * symbols without importing or declaring it, or calls `this.something` that the class
 * shown in the same snippet does not define.
 *
 * Layer: repository tooling. Nothing here ships — `scripts/` is outside `files`.
 *
 * Why it exists: this defect class recurred across four review rounds of the same
 * pull request — a snippet referencing `safeMinLevel`, `LOGGER_OPTIONS_TOKEN`,
 * `PREVIEW_LENGTH` or `this.reportShutdownFailure` with nothing to resolve them.
 * Reviewing prose by eye does not catch it; parsing does.
 *
 * How it decides. Three questions, all answered from the syntax tree rather than from
 * a regular expression, because a name inside a comment or a string is a MENTION and
 * only a name in an expression is a USE:
 *
 *   1. Does the snippet use a symbol this package declares in `src/` — an export or a
 *      module-level constant — while neither importing nor declaring it?
 *   2. Does it read `this.member` while declaring the enclosing class itself?
 *   3. Does it read `SOME_CONSTANT.KEY` for a key that constant does not define?
 *
 * Question 2 is asked only of snippets that show a complete class. A snippet that is
 * openly an excerpt of one method has no class to check against, and demanding one
 * would push every excerpt toward being a full file.
 *
 * Question 3 exists because question 1 cannot see it: a property is not a reference, so
 * an invented `RESERVED_LOG_KEYS.LOGGER_DESTINATION_SHUTDOWN_FAILED` reads as a use of
 * `RESERVED_LOG_KEYS` — which IS imported — and passes. It reached this documentation
 * exactly that way.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT checked: a free local like `health` in an excerpt whose scope the
 * prose introduces. Flagging those means flagging every excerpt variable, and the
 * noise would retire the check. That case stays a matter of writing the prose well.
 *
 * The baseline. The planning documents carry 43 distinct file-and-symbol pairs from
 * before the check existed — fewer than the raw occurrence count, since one missing
 * import usually shows up in several snippets of the same document. Fixing all of them
 * is not the same job as stopping new ones, so they are recorded in
 * `doc-snippets-baseline.json`: a finding outside it fails, and an entry inside it that
 * no longer reproduces ALSO fails, so a fixed snippet cannot leave a stale line behind.
 * Regenerate with
 * `--write-baseline` — which writes the INTERSECTION of the old baseline and what still
 * reproduces, so it can only remove entries. A defect introduced in the same edit is
 * not adopted by it; the run still fails.
 *
 * Widening what the check looks at is the one case where the list legitimately grows.
 * It has happened twice: accepting `ts` fences alongside `typescript`, then accepting
 * indented and longer fences plus destructured exports. Each surfaced pre-existing
 * findings in documents nobody had touched — not regressions. That takes `--adopt-new`, a separate flag precisely so the
 * decision is made on purpose and stated in the commit rather than taken silently by the
 * routine command.
 *
 * Baseline entries are keyed by file and symbol, not by line, so editing prose above a
 * snippet does not churn the file. The cost of that choice is one real gap: a NEW
 * snippet in an already-listed file that omits the SAME symbol is absorbed by the
 * existing entry. Anything else — a new symbol, a new file, any `this.member` — fails.
